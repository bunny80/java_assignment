1.Use a List. Choose a random employee by picking a number between 0 and size()-1.

2.Use a Set. Collections that implement this interface don't allow the same element to be entered more than once.

3.Use a Map, where the keys are first names, and each value is a count of the number of employees with that first name.

4.Use a Queue. Invoke add() to add employees to the waiting list, and remove() to remove them.
